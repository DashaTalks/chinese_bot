BUGS:
- logging exceptions from text update
- if you try to update text only in eng - there is no mistake
- delete redundate message from text reading process, or copy again text
- add fuc to delete yourself
- fix dictionary so you can add words as learning
- при создание нового юзера - формируется новая таблица, где все тексты отмечены как нечитанные - птом статус меняется
- check if user give only the number
- get the exit from the process of getting nex texts
- we got a question "i wanna upload more text" after reading texts from the lib
- if there is no enough texts in good texts. bugs
- aiogram.utils.exceptions.MessageTextIsEmpty: Message text is empty



MWP
- you can check words
- you can give words status - learning - know
- you can get texts that are made from your words

TODO
- logging word search


LATER

retrieve info from the database on persons vocab + how many times does he check those words - new words, rare words
- Перенести в env по базе данных
- upload_admin_text (either close it or manage somehow - only u can use it)
- get the texts - based on HSK chosen
- any command should be impossible if you are not registered
- there is a data on how often you read those words
- text you get is according to your lang level
- add examples to words from the persons library
- dictionary.py - refactor. you need to first check lang then translate. to improve reusability
- check texts with empty list of words

!!! you really really need to deal with words that are not translated somehow!!!!!!
